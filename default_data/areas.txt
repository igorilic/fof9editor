Information about defined areas within countries. In the US, counties are used with codes 2000-99999 reserved (1000 * state census code + county census code). Every county in the US is included, with some overlap in Virigina with their city as county concept. In Canada, provinces are used (100-149). In the UK, regions are used, and refer to a county, major city area, combination of counties, or combination of census districts.
