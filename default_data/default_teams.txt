default_teams.csv

Information used to create teams when starting a new league, and no specific single-year configuration is used. Teams are connected to a specific league structure instead. This information is not used when starting a new league when random team hosts are selected.

Note that if you're changing team information and using a default player file shipped with the game, changing this file will have no effect on a new universe.
