This is the overview for using a custom player file with Front Office Football Nine. An example set of files is provided.

This is an advanced customization feature that allows much greater control over your universe. No customer support is available for working with these files.

Files included:

xxxx refers to a identifier you give your custom player file. It can be anything. In the custom_example folder off of the installation, the identifier for the sample set is example.

xxxx_info.csv: An overview of your league. The SCHEDULEID header must match the SCHEDULEID of an entry in the installation's league_info.csv for the type of league you are creating. While this, too, can be customized, each entry in league_info.csv requires full schedule support.

xxxx_players.csv: The players for your league. Players who are available when the league starts are given a BASE_YEAR that matches the BASE_YEAR in the xxxx_info.csv file. When a draft class is created during simulation, the game will look for entries in this file to add as draftable players for that season.

xxxx_quarterbacks.csv: The quarterbacks for your league. This works the same way the xxxx_players.csv file works. You can still select the historic quarterbacks option when using this file.

xxxx_coaches: Coaches for your league. These only apply to the initiation of your league. Future coaches can't be created in this manner.

When beginning a new universe and loading a set of custom player files, choose the xxxx_info.csv file.
